<h2> Hi there </h2>

I'm from Amazonas, Brazil and I'm a student at the *Center for Analysis, Research and Technological Innovation Foundation - FUCAPI*, always aiming for my creative training for exclusive uses in technological improvements.

I have experience in **UX/UI Design**, **Design Thinking** and **Design Patterns**, always improving my skills in creating beautiful and intuitive interfaces. Due to this notion, I transitioned to *Front-End Development*, gaining skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **ES6**, **React**, **Context API**, **Styled Components**, **SASS**, **Material UI** and creating prototypes using **Figma** and managing projects using the **Agile SCRUM Methodology**. As a *Back-End*, I learned **Python** for **Marchine Learning**, **Big Data** and **Deep Learning** at Federal.
